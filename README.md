## Executive Summary

The Structured Memory Engine (SME) represents a significant advancement in AI-driven conversation systems, directly addressing the critical limitations of current commercial chatbot platforms. By implementing a sophisticated semantic memory architecture, SME transforms ephemeral interactions into persistent, contextually-aware conversational experiences with enhanced relevance and continuity.

## Problem Statement

Modern AI-driven chatbots have significantly advanced in conversational capabilities but still face fundamental limitations regarding context retention and memory persistence. These limitations undermine their effectiveness in delivering sustained, meaningful interactions over extended periods or across multiple sessions.

### Key Limitations of Current AI Chatbots

#### 1. Limited Context Window

Commercially available chatbot platforms such as OpenAI's GPT-4, Anthropic's Claude, or Google's Gemini maintain a fixed-size context window, typically ranging between approximately 4,000 and 32,000 tokens. Once a conversation exceeds this predefined limit, older interactions are automatically discarded, causing the chatbot to lose previously discussed context (OpenAI, 2024; Anthropic, 2024).

As OpenAI explicitly states, "ChatGPT has limited memory and will lose context from the beginning of the conversation after a certain threshold, causing it to repeat questions or lose coherence" (OpenAI Help Center, 2024). This limitation results in repetitive questions, fragmented conversational continuity, and diminished user experience.

#### 2. Lack of Persistent Cross-Session Memory

Most existing AI chat systems are inherently stateless, meaning each new user session starts fresh without referencing prior interactions unless explicitly engineered otherwise. Amazon's Bedrock AI documentation confirms this design limitation, noting that by default, conversational agents retain context only within a single session. For context to persist across sessions, developers must explicitly implement external memory management systems (Amazon Bedrock Documentation, 2023).

This inherent statelessness leads to:

- Poor user experience, due to repetitive questions and forgotten context (Humanloop, 2024).
- Operational inefficiency, as users repeatedly re-enter previously shared information.
- Limited AI adaptability and personalization, preventing chatbots from evolving based on long-term interaction history.

While frameworks such as LangChain and LlamaIndex aim to mitigate some of these challenges by adding context management layers, their complexity, ongoing maintenance overhead, and lack of structured memory management often hinder widespread adoption and practical usability (LangChain Documentation, 2024).

### The Need for Structured, Persistent AI Memory

To overcome these significant limitations, chatbots require an advanced, structured memory framework that ensures context persistence across interactions, sessions, and even platforms. Such a structured approach would drastically improve conversational continuity, accuracy, personalization, and overall user experience.

The Structured Memory Engine (SME) directly addresses these critical challenges by providing structured, scalable, intelligent memory managementâ€”transforming ephemeral interactions into coherent, continuous, and meaningful long-term conversations.

## ðŸ”§ Setup Requirements

- Node.js v18+ and npm 8+
- PostgreSQL 14+ with pgvector extension
- OpenAI API key and/or Anthropic API key
- For authentication: Either Replit account (for Replit environment) or your own authentication system

### Replit-Specific Dependencies

This project was initially developed for the Replit platform and uses several Replit-specific features:

1. **Replit Auth**: The authentication system uses Replit's built-in OAuth service
2. **Replit Secrets**: Environment variables are stored in Replit's Secrets system
3. **Replit Database**: The PostgreSQL database is automatically configured by Replit

These features need to be reconfigured when deploying outside of Replit. See the deployment sections below for alternatives.

## ðŸš¦ Getting Started

### Running on Replit

1. Fork this repository on Replit
2. Set up Replit Secrets (environment variables):
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Your Anthropic API key
   - `SESSION_SECRET`: A random string for session encryption
3. The PostgreSQL database will be automatically set up by Replit
4. Run the application using the Start button or the Replit Run command

### Running Outside Replit Environment

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables in a `.env` file:
   ```
   # Database configuration
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/memory_engine
   PGUSER=your_postgres_user
   PGPASSWORD=your_postgres_password
   PGDATABASE=memory_engine
   PGHOST=localhost
   PGPORT=5432
   
   # API Keys
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
   PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_key
   
   # Session configuration
   SESSION_SECRET=your_random_secret_string
   ```
4. Install and enable the pgvector extension in your PostgreSQL database:
   ```sql
   CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
   ```
5. Initialize the database:
   ```
   npm run db:push
   ```
6. Replace Replit authentication with your own auth system:
   - The application uses Replit's authentication service by default
   - To use your own authentication system:
     1. Modify `server/routes/auth.ts` to integrate with your preferred auth provider
     2. Update the login/logout endpoints to work with your authentication system
     3. Update `client/src/hooks/useAuth.ts` to match your authentication API responses
   - Alternatively, you can implement a simpler authentication method like:
     - JWT-based authentication with Passport.js
     - Auth0, Firebase Auth, or other authentication services
     - Basic username/password authentication for local development
   - Here's a simple example of a local development auth system in the [Authentication Guide](#authentication-guide)
7. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Authentication Guide

This project uses Replit Authentication by default, which is only available within the Replit platform. When running outside of Replit, you'll need to implement your own authentication system. Here's a basic example of implementing a simple authentication system:

1. Install required packages:
   ```
   npm install jsonwebtoken passport passport-local express-session
   ```

2. Create a new authentication middleware file at `server/middleware/local-auth.ts`:
   ```typescript
   import { Request, Response, NextFunction } from 'express';
   import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';

   // Get JWT secret from environment variable
   const JWT_SECRET = process.env.SESSION_SECRET || 'your-fallback-secret';

   interface UserInfo {
     id: string;
     name: string;
     profileImage?: string;
   }

   // Extend the Express Request type to include a user property
   declare global {
     namespace Express {
       interface Request {
         user?: UserInfo;
       }
     }
   }

   // Verify JWT token from Authorization header
   export function authMiddleware(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
     // Get token from Authorization header
     const authHeader = req.headers.authorization;
     const token = authHeader && authHeader.split(' ')[1];
     
     if (!token) {
       return res.status(401).json({ 
         error: 'Unauthorized',
         message: 'No token provided' 
       });
     }
     
     try {
       // Verify token
       const user = jwt.verify(token, JWT_SECRET) as UserInfo;
       req.user = user;
       next();
     } catch (err) {
       return res.status(401).json({ 
         error: 'Unauthorized',
         message: 'Invalid token' 
       });
     }
   }

   // Check if user is authenticated
   export function isAuthenticated(req: Request): boolean {
     return !!req.user;
   }

   // Get current user
   export function getCurrentUser(req: Request): UserInfo | null {
     return req.user || null;
   }
   ```

3. Update your auth routes in `server/routes/auth.ts`:
   ```typescript
   import express from 'express';
   import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';

   const router = express.Router();
   const JWT_SECRET = process.env.SESSION_SECRET || 'your-fallback-secret';

   // Sample users (in a real app, these would be in a database)
   const users = [
     { id: '1', username: 'user', password: 'password', name: 'Demo User' }
   ];

   // Login route
   router.post('/login', (req, res) => {
     const { username, password } = req.body;
     
     // Find user by username and password
     const user = users.find(u => u.username === username && u.password === password);
     
     if (!user) {
       return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid credentials' });
     }
     
     // Create token
     const token = jwt.sign({ id: user.id, name: user.name }, JWT_SECRET, { expiresIn: '24h' });
     
     res.json({ token });
   });

   // Get current user info
   router.get('/user', (req, res) => {
     // Auth middleware adds user to request if token is valid
     const authHeader = req.headers.authorization;
     const token = authHeader && authHeader.split(' ')[1];
     
     if (!token) {
       return res.json({ authenticated: false, user: null });
     }
     
     try {
       const user = jwt.verify(token, JWT_SECRET);
       return res.json({ authenticated: true, user });
     } catch (err) {
       return res.json({ authenticated: false, user: null });
     }
   });

   export default router;
   ```

4. Update your `client/src/hooks/useAuth.ts` file:
   ```typescript
   import { useQuery, useMutation } from "@tanstack/react-query";
   import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
   import { apiRequest } from "@/lib/queryClient";
   import { API_ROUTES } from "@/lib/constants";

   interface UserInfo {
     id: string;
     name: string;
     profileImage?: string;
   }

   interface AuthResponse {
     authenticated: boolean;
     user: UserInfo | null;
   }

   interface LoginCredentials {
     username: string;
     password: string;
   }

   export function useAuth() {
     // Get token from localStorage
     const [token, setToken] = useState<string | null>(
       typeof window !== 'undefined' ? localStorage.getItem('auth_token') : null
     );

     // Function to handle login
     const login = useMutation({
       mutationFn: async (credentials: LoginCredentials) => {
         const response = await apiRequest(API_ROUTES.AUTH.LOGIN, {
           method: 'POST',
           body: JSON.stringify(credentials),
           headers: {
             'Content-Type': 'application/json'
           }
         });
         return response.json();
       },
       onSuccess: (data) => {
         if (data.token) {
           localStorage.setItem('auth_token', data.token);
           setToken(data.token);
         }
       }
     });

     // Function to handle logout
     const logout = () => {
       localStorage.removeItem('auth_token');
       setToken(null);
     };

     // Get current user
     const { data, isLoading, error, refetch } = useQuery<AuthResponse>({
       queryKey: [API_ROUTES.AUTH.USER],
       queryFn: async () => {
         if (!token) return { authenticated: false, user: null };
         
         const response = await fetch(API_ROUTES.AUTH.USER, {
           headers: {
             'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
           }
         });
         return response.json();
       },
       enabled: !!token,
     });

     // Refresh auth when token changes
     useEffect(() => {
       if (token) {
         refetch();
       }
     }, [token, refetch]);

     return {
       isAuthenticated: !!data?.authenticated,
       user: data?.user || null,
       isLoading,
       error,
       login,
       logout,
     };
   }
   ```

This is a simplified example for local development. For production use, consider using established authentication services or frameworks.

### Contextual Retrieval Mechanism

The SME employs a proprietary hybrid retrieval approach that combines:

1. **Dynamic Query Analysis**: Incoming queries are algorithmically classified as questions or statements, with different retrieval parameters applied to each type
   
2. **Similarity Threshold Adaptation**: The system dynamically adjusts similarity thresholds based on query type, conversation history, and user behavior patterns

3. **Hybrid Scoring Algorithm**: Retrieved memories are ranked using a sophisticated algorithm combining vector similarity with keyword matching and relevance scoring

### Enhanced Response Generation

The multi-stage response generation process ensures AI outputs are contextually grounded and informationally rich:

1. **Context Augmentation**: The most relevant memories are selectively incorporated into the AI prompt
2. **Provider-Agnostic Integration**: A unified interface allows seamless switching between OpenAI and Anthropic models while maintaining consistent memory access
3. **Feedback Loop Integration**: User interactions implicitly refine memory relevance scoring over time
